	        <p> The University of Rochester is committed to bridging the gender gap in computer science. This website is dedicated to our efforts in recognizing and supporting women in computing, both at our institution and all others around the world. We are taking great measures to increase the enrollment of female computer science students through the four following methods: </p>

Exercises are based on problems from a variety of engineering disciplines, including electrical, mechanical, and chemical engineering.  Although this course was designed for freshman engineering majors, it is appropriate for students in any discipline interested in practical scientific programming and data analysis. </td>

Although Python is significantly easier to learn and use than Java, the concepts learned in this course also provide a good background for students going on to learn Java in CSC 171.

                    <p>Through the creation of the 'UR Women in Computing' group as a subcommittee under the Computer Science Undergraduate Council, we are fostering the development of a community among the women in the CS Department. Through the organization of events, hackathons, potlucks and workshops among the members of UR WIC, we hope to instill a sense of bonding among the women in the CS department that is inclusive, welcoming and supportive.</p>

                    <p>The B.A. curriculum is highly flexible, and can be customized to support students interested in the intersection of computer science with other disciplines, such as mathematics, digital media studies, financial economics or linguistics.  The B.A. is good preparation for students aiming for an industrial career or graduate study in a computing-related discipline.  Because it has fewer requirements than the B.S., it is also a good option for students who wish to double-major in computer science and another subject, or who wish to specialize in a particular area of computer science.</p

Some examples of previous outreach programs are Girl Scout Campus Events where students demonstrate and discuss their research and projects to visiting Girl Scouts. We have also had students go into local grade-school classrooms and introduce computer science as a discipline to students and answer questions about the field and their studies.</p>
